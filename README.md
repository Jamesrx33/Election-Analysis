# **<p align="center">Election Results Analysis</p>**

### **<p align="center">A Python-based analytics report designed to determine the winner of a local Colorado election.</p>**

---
## Overview
This report will display the results of a local Colorado election, given data provided from the election commission in CSV format. Using Python to iterate through and process each recorded vote, we have determined the victor of this election and outputted the results in a .txt file. Per request, we have also provided voter turnout metrics per county and the county with the largest turnout overall. Should this report meet the expectations of the election commission, it is our desire that this code me implemented in future elections.

1. Total Number of Votes: 369,711

![Original Code 2017](https://github.com/Jamesrx33/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017_Original_Code.png?raw=true) ![Original Code 2018](https://github.com/Jamesrx33/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018_Original_Code.png?raw=true)

After refactoring the code, these times were reduced to .09s(rounded) for the analysis of both 2017 and 2018

## Conclusion
Given that the return on investment was both substantial and consistent throughout 2017 and 2018, I would recommend that Steve's parents **invest in "ENPH" stock.**

## Summary
Refactoring code has a variety of costs and benefits. The process of refactoring can be time-consuming and involve the use of advanced data structures, many of which are difficult to grasp and implement. However, the use of code refactoring can lead to more fluent applications that are easier for a third party to interpret. Most importantly, refactored code can exponentially improve the run-time and performance of your code. This can be a vital practice for both large and small scale projects, as seen in our VBA script written in this module. We were able to implement multiple arrays into our code in an effort to reduce the number of For loop iterations. This process took a fair amount of time and required a rewrite of our logic. But we managed to increase the worst-case performance of the script from .7s to .09s (An improvement of 678%!).
